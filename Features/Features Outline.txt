HERE ARE THE INTENDED FEATURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

#------------------------------
ACCOUNT CLASS

    DESCRIPTION:
        1. Each instance of the class keeps track of each personal account (banks, credit cards, investments, etc.)
        2. Quick snap-shot information shall be accessible (total value, etc.)
        3. A full history of all transactions is also stored (in a csv table, for now, and a database in the future?)
        
    NOTES:
        1. To avoid the horrendous runtime of the portfolio class, each additional transaction should update all affected metrics
            within the account class
